This project was part of 42's Computer Science Common Core, where i continued
to solidify my basics of C programming, and it was also an introduction into
algorithms, scalability, efficiency and the big O notation.
In this project, i was tasked with creating a program that would sort a group
of integers in ascending order by only using push / swap / rotate actions of
two virtual stacks of data, and also doing so inside a limit number of actions,
depending on how many integers there were to sort.
Like every single other 42 project, it had several goals in mind:
- continued practice of basic C syntax, logic, data types and structures;
- dynamic data allocation managing;
- use of tools like GDB and Valgrind to debug, avoid memory leaks and errors;
- incomplete instructions to promote self learning and error solving;
- familiarity with Makefile and compilers;
- study and use of different sorting algorithms;
- performance testing and analysis using the big O notation;
- etc;

This project was made while studying in 42 Porto as part of the Computer Science
Common Core curriculum.
It was made according to 42's Norm for good code etiquette, which includes rules regarding:
- correct indentation;
- maximum line lenght of 81 characters;
- maximum function size of 25 lines;
- maximum 5 functions per file;
- mandatory 42 signature file header;
- forbidden use of "for", "do / while", "switch / case", "goto";
- and many others...
